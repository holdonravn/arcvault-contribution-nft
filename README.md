## üöÄ Deployment / Roles (Placeholder)

> **Note:** These addresses are placeholders for pre-launch/testnet only. Replace with actual addresses before mainnet deployment.

| Role              | Address (Placeholder)       | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `SIGNER_ROLE`     | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` | Signs verified contributions (multisig recommended, no timelock). |
| `POLICY_ADMIN`    | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` | Controls pause/SBT toggle; assign to a multisig with timelock. |
| `METADATA_ADMIN`  | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` | Can update metadata before freeze; lower threshold multisig possible. |
| `UPGRADER_ROLE`   | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` | Controls contract upgrades; separate from policy admin. |

üìå **Security Tip:** Use Gnosis Safe for each role with different member sets, and apply `TimelockController` (24‚Äì48h) for POLICY_ADMIN and UPGRADER_ROLE.

Governance & Roles
## Deployment

### Testnet Setup
1. Deploy contracts to {testnet name}.
2. Assign roles using the addresses below (placeholders for testnet use only).

### Roles (placeholders)

> **Note:** These addresses are placeholders for testnet.  
> Final mainnet roles will be assigned via multisig + timelock before launch.

- `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` (TBD)
- `SIGNER_ROLE`: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` (TBD)
- `POLICY_ADMIN`: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` (TBD)

- ## CI / Security
- Every PR runs tests, coverage and Slither static analysis (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- No secrets in repo: use `.env` (testnet only). See `SECURITY.md` for disclosure policy.

## Examples
- EIP-712 signing snippets in `examples/`:
  - `sign-mint.ts` ‚Üí produce `signature` + payload for `mintWithSig`
  - `sign-update.ts` ‚Üí produce `signature` + payload for `updateWithSig`
