üìç Why / Use Case

### Why ArcVault Contribution NFT?
Traditional methods of recognizing open-source or community contributions‚Äîsuch as off-chain leaderboards, forum posts, or centralized badges‚Äîare non-verifiable, easily manipulated, and rarely portable across projects or ecosystems. ArcVault Contribution NFT solves this problem by turning every meaningful on-chain or off-chain contribution into a secure, upgradeable, and verifiable NFT badge backed by cryptographic proof.

With ArcVault, individual contributors, DAOs, enterprises, and developer communities can transparently track, verify, and reward all forms of contributions‚Äîcode, security, research, community building, outreach‚Äîon any EVM-compatible chain.

---

### Use Cases

- **Open Source DAOs & Protocols:**  
Reward developers and active community members with non-transferable (Soulbound) NFTs that represent unique, verifiable contributions‚Äîsuch as deploying new features, fixing bugs, or auditing code.

- **Enterprise & Team Environments:**  
Issue digitally signed, immutable contribution records for employees or external collaborators, making performance reviews, bounties, and team reputation portable and tamper-proof.

- **Event and Community Recognition:**  
Distribute NFT-based badges for hackathon participation, event organization, public speaking, technical writing, or ambassador programs that remain provable and updatable over time.

- **Growth Campaigns & Ambassadorships:**  
Track marketing, outreach, or onboarding contributions‚Äîincluding content creation, social media activity, or partnership formation‚Äîeach recorded and verified on-chain.

- **Reputation and Attestation:**  
Integrate with on-chain governance or attestation protocols to leverage verifiable contribution history for voting rights, incentives, or access control within DAOs.

---

**In summary:**  
ArcVault is the missing, secure, and upgradeable layer for turning any on-chain or off-chain contribution into a portable, provable achievement that strengthens your project‚Äôs transparency, reputation, and incentives.

## üöÄ Deployment / Roles (Placeholder)

> **Note:** These addresses are placeholders for pre-launch/testnet only. Replace with actual addresses before mainnet deployment.

| Role              | Address (Placeholder)       | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `SIGNER_ROLE`     | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` | Signs verified contributions (multisig recommended, no timelock). |
| `POLICY_ADMIN`    | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` | Controls pause/SBT toggle; assign to a multisig with timelock. |
| `METADATA_ADMIN`  | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` | Can update metadata before freeze; lower threshold multisig possible. |
| `UPGRADER_ROLE`   | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` | Controls contract upgrades; separate from policy admin. |

üìå **Security Tip:** Use Gnosis Safe for each role with different member sets, and apply `TimelockController` (24‚Äì48h) for POLICY_ADMIN and UPGRADER_ROLE.

- Every PR runs tests, coverage and Slither static analysis (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- No secrets in repo: use `.env` (testnet only). See `SECURITY.md` for disclosure policy.

## Examples
- EIP-712 signing snippets in `examples/`:
  - `sign-mint.ts` ‚Üí produce `signature` + payload for `mintWithSig`
  - `sign-update.ts` ‚Üí produce `signature` + payload for `updateWithSig`
