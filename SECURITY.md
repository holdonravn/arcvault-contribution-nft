## 📂 Scope of Policy

This policy covers:

- ✅ Smart contracts in the `contracts/` directory
- ✅ Hardhat configurations used for deployment
- ✅ Testnet-specific security assumptions

❌ Out of Scope:

- ❌ Front-end apps (React, Next.js, etc.)
- ❌ Off-chain services (relayers, bots, APIs)
- ❌ 3rd-party infra (RPC, indexers, Graph, explorers)

---

## 🚫 Known Non-Issues

- Testnet contracts may be upgraded or redeployed at any time.
- Roles and multisigs are **placeholders** during testnet.
- Metadata and contract structure may change before launch.

---

## 🏛 Governance & Upgrade Policy

- Mainnet contracts will use **Gnosis Safe** with **TimelockController (24–48h)**.
- All privileged roles (`SIGNER`, `UPGRADER`, `POLICY_ADMIN`, `METADATA_ADMIN`) will be assigned to multisigs.

---

## 🔒 User Security Tips

- Never share private keys, seed phrases, or access tokens.
- Only use contracts verified from the official GitHub and block explorer links.
- For multisig admins, use Gnosis Safe with appropriate threshold settings.
- Always verify that `.env` and `secrets` files are excluded from Git via `.gitignore`.
